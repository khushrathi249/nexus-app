🧠 Nexus - Your Second Brain for Social ContentNexus is a self-hosted, AI-powered bookmarking tool designed to organize the chaos of social media saves. It takes links (Instagram Reels, TikToks, YouTube Shorts) sent via Telegram, downloads the video content, and uses Multimodal AI (Gemini 2.0) to watch, listen, and analyze them.It automatically categorizes content, extracts recipes/ingredients, identifies travel locations (with map coordinates), and transcribes visual text—turning mindless scrolling into a searchable knowledge base.✨ Key FeaturesZero-Friction Capture: Send a link to your Telegram Bot. That's it.Multimodal AI Analysis: Nexus downloads the video and uses Google Gemini to "watch" it. It extracts:Recipes: Ingredients and steps (even if only shown on screen).Travel: Specific landmarks and cities with geocoordinates.Tech/Education: Summaries of the core lesson.Smart Geocoding: Automatically maps travel content using Ola Maps or OpenStreetMap."Ask Nexus" (RAG): Chat with your saved database. Ask "Where was that sushi place?" or "Show me pasta recipes" and it searches your saved content.User Isolation: Multi-user support. Your data is private to your Telegram ID.Visual Dashboard: A clean, mobile-responsive Streamlit web app to browse, search, and manage your stacks.🛠️ Tech StackBackend: Python 3.11Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase/Neon)AI Engine: Google Gemini 1.5/2.0 FlashScraping: yt-dlp + requests (with stealth headers)Frontend: StreamlitInterface: python-telegram-botDeployment: Docker (Optimized for Render.com)🚀 Local Installation1.
